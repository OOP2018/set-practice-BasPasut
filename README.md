* When you print elements in the set, are they in same order as you added them?  
Ans : No, they aren't.

* what is the command to remove all elements from a `set`?  
Ans : set.clear();

* When you add elements in a different order and print them, did the order change?  
Ans : Yes, they did.

* Can you add a duplicate "cat" and "dog" to set?  
Ans : No. Because set is a collection that cannot collect duplicate data.

* What is the result when you use TreeSet instead of HashSet?  
Ans : When I print with TreeSet, elements in the collection is already sorted, but HashSet isn't.

* Could we make `setExplorer` work with either Set or List?  How?  
Ans : Yes, we can make it by create parameter of setExplorer method that receive Collection. So now we can both use Set, List and others that implement Collection.
